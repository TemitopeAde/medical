                        <p>
                            Chinese Medicine incorporates the teachings which have been fundamental
                             to the practice of acupuncture, Chinese herbology, and Chinese medical
                              philosophy for over 3000 years. Traditional Chinese Medicine is a
                               complete therapeutic system with the end goal of mental, physical, spiritual wellbeing. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Using classical analytic methods of tongue, pulse, questioning, 
                            observation and palpation, the Chinese Medical practitioner 
                            analyzes the collective information to find the patterns in
                             the body that correlate to ill health. The goal of traditional
                              Chinese Medicine is to bring the body back into dynamic
                               homeostasis with the natural environment, to allow the body 
                               to adapt and change in a healthy “dance with the 
                            internal and external variability of day-to-day life” by using minimally invasive techniques.

                            <h4>Acupuncture</h4>
                            <p>
                                Through the use of hair-thin filliform needles, (or needle-free if preferred) 
                                the Chinese acupuncturist seeks to target specific pathways in the body 
                                in order to pinpoint the root of the problem. There are 12 meridians 
                                in the human body, corresponding to the gall bladder, lung, liver,
                                 large intestine, spleen, stomach, heart, small intestine, bladder, 
                                 kidney, triple warmer, and pericardium. There are also several
                                  meridians that do not correspond directly to an energetic organ
                                   system in the body such as the penetrating vessel, the governing and the conception vessel. 
                                The basis of this system relies on understanding
                                 of astrology, climactic influence and other factors.

                                <h6>Acupressure</h6>
                                <p>
                                    Acupressure is similar to acupuncture in that the treatment 
                                    is targeting blockages in the meridians with strategically 
                                    placed pressure with a finger or other tool (tuning fork, blunt instrument). 
                                    Acupressure does not pierce the skin and is safe for those that have a phobia
                                     of needles or would prefer this gentler method. Acupressure is also used for young children, 
                                    the elderly, and any other client preferring not to use needles for any reason.

                                    With all of these tools and many more, a good Chinese Medicine
                                     practitioner will never say, “There is nothing more I can do.”

                                <p>Based on the information received from tongue, pulse, 
                                    palpation and interview a precise and individually catered formula

                                      modifications due to the individual nature of each person, these

                                <h6>Cupping</h6>
                                <p>Cupping dates back to 281 AD, used widely by ancient Taoists. 
                                    Incidentally, evidence of cupping has also been found in deep East Asia, 
                                    Japan, the Korean peninsula and the Arabian Desert. Traditionally, 
                                    cups were made from the horns of animals but evolved into bamboo
                                     cups and eventually glass was used as a vehicle for therapeutic cupping.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Using the power of suction, cupping loosens adhesions, relaxes the muscles and has proven effective for many
                                     problems of the pulmonary, musculoskeletal and vascular system.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Cupping feels similar to a deep tissue massage and has
                                     been made popular by many of the glitterati in Hollywood.
                                </p>
