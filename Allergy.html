                        <p>
                            Allergies are an exaggerated reaction of the immune system to a
                             substance that would not normally cause a reaction in most 
                             individuals. The immune system perceives a particular substance (dust, mold, pollen, 
                            chemical, etc.) as a threat and triggers the 
                            release of histamine, causing an allergic symptom.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Classic allergy symptoms are sneezes, runny nose, hives, 
                            itchy and watery eyes, and itchy throat. In fact, allergies
                             may cause a vast range of symptoms, from fatigue and 
                             depression to constipation, joint pain, 
                             facial swelling, headaches and chronic sinusitis.
                             Allergies put stress on the immune system and can affect every major system of the body.

                        <h4>Holistic Integrative Medical Approach to Allergy Testing & Treatment
                        </h4>
                        <h6>Treat the Immune System and the Neurological System</h6>
                        <p>
                            Allergies affect both the immune system and the autonomic nervous system.
                             NIHA'S dual allergy testing and treatment strategy addresses both the 
                             immune system response and the autonomic nervous system response to the 
                             allergen.  Allergy serums customized for you are the treatment for 
                             allergies. The serums cause the immune system to build up blocking 
                             antibodies that turn off the allergic response, and can even 
                             eliminate the allergy, given an appropriate length of treatment. 
                             When combined with Allergy Elimination Technique, which helps calm the 
                            autonomic nervous system, you can find relief from allergies and may get better faster. 
                        </p>

                        <h6>Painless, Needle Free Allergy Testing</h6>
                        <p>
                            During the testing phase we use a painless, needle free
                             biofeedback tool, <a href="#">Electrodermal Screening (EAV)</a>  
                             to scan the major body systems, identify allergens
                              and establish the individual's formulation for allergy
                               serums. Complete screening for molds, pollen, inhalants
                                (dust, smuts, animal dander), phenol, glycerin, 
                                and TOE is given. If indicated, testing and 
                                treatment for chemicals, hormones, and food sensitivities 
                                will be administered.  After this initial 60 minute visit, 
                                which includes a comprehensive medical and environmental history, a clear picture of your 
                            health status and disturbances in your body which may contribute to allergy will emerge.
                        </p>

                        <h6>Customized Serum Allergy Treatment with Oral Immunotherapy for Quick Relief</h6>
                        <p>
                            Once the allergens have been identified, a treatment strategy 
                            will be developed based on serums. Sublingual (under the tongue)
                             immunotherapy for treating allergies will reduce or suppress 
                             the immune response to the allergy.  It decreases the allergic
                              response to allergens and balances the immune 
                              system.A balanced immune system is better able 
                            to handle the offending allergen,  so that allergic reactions are decreased or may even disappear.
                        </p>
                        <p>Electrodermal screening is used to formulate the correct 
                            dilution of your serum. Customized serums are delivered 
                            in the form of shots or oral drops and address the 
                            immunological component of allergies. On subsequent
                             visits the patient will build up to the correct dosage 
                             of serums and their progress will be monitored. On average,
                              patients report relief from allergy symptoms within 6-12 
                              weeks of starting treatment. Once patients are safely tolerating
                             the serum treatment they are allowed to self-administer at home, saving time, travel, and money.</p>

                        <h6>Additional Help for the Allergy and/or Multiple Chemical Sensitive Patient</h6>
                        <p>The integrative, holistic approach to allergy treatment is usually sufficient, 
                            but sometimes there may be an underlying disturbance contributing to the 
                            body's tendency to overreact. We seek to also identify these root causes 
                            of allergy by looking further at possible sources of toxicity. 
                            We are able to test for and treat these issues which may contribute to allergies or sensitivities.
                        </p>

                        <h6>Possible Sources of Disturbance:</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Diet (food allergies and/or food sensitivities or intolerances)</li>
                            <li>Chemicals in Personal Care Products, Water, or Environment</li>

                                Molds</li>
                            <li>Heavy Metals (smoking, exposure)</li>

                        <p> <b>Dietary modifications</b>may be helpful for food sensitivities.
                             Keeping track of what you eat with a diet diary, 
                            then using a rotation diet or an elimination diet 
                            will help manage symptoms and treatment.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p><b>Sinusitis</b> is inflammation of the sinuses and can cause pain,
                             headache or facial swelling. A nasal wash or neti pot helps 
                             to drain the sinuses and relieve pain. Decongestants,
                              steam inhalation, and drinking plenty of water are
                               other cost effective treatments. Chicken soup and ginger tea have anti-inflammatory 
                            properties which may be helpful. If there is fever or 
                            persistent swelling antibiotics may be needed.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <p>Detoxification may be suggested as part of your allergy treatment 
                            if toxicity is found. Detoxification and rehabilitation 
                            of the bowel is essential to all healing as it restores 
                            balance in the gastrointestinal system.
                             The gastrointestinal system, "the gut" is our first 
                             line of defense in our immune system.</p>

                        <h6>Environmental Assessment</h6>
                        <p>
                            An environmental assessment for allergies is a key 
                            component of the integrative approach to identifying 
                            and treating allergies and/or chronic disease.
                             A complete, comprehensive medical and dental history of
                             the patient is necessary in order to determine the timing of allergy and/or sickness.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>At what point did the patient become sick or develop allergies?</li>
                            <li>Where did the patient live and work?</li>
                            <li>Did the patient ever have a tooth extracted or a root canal?</li>
                            <li>What is the age of the patient's home?</li>
                            <li>Has the patient been exposed to mold, chemicals or other toxins?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These are important questions in order to assess the internal
                             and external living environment. If necessary, 
                             additional testing of the home using mold panels 
                             can be done to further pinpoint the root cause of
                              the problem which may be contributing to allergy or sickness.</p>
