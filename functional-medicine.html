                        <p>
                            <b>Functional medicine involves testing for the root causes of disease and/or psychiatric disorders, and designing a treatment plan to address the root cause of the disorder, not just the symptoms.  It views and treats the body as a whole system.</b>
                        </p>

                        <p>The use of the word "functional" is key to understanding the functional and integrative medical approach.  Functional lab tests help determine how the body or organ is really working, or functioning, as opposed to other medical tests which measure pathological breakdown and disease.</p>
                        
                        <p>A sub-optimal functional test may indicate a need for correction even though traditional testing may show everything is within the normal range. This is a subtle but important difference as many sub-optimal health conditions will cause symptoms that get us to the doctor, but then no reason can be found for what is causing our health problem.</p>
                        
                        <h6 class="mt-2">Functional Medicine Doctors Find and Treat the Root Cause of Illness</h6>
                        <p>Functional medicine searches for the underlying imbalance, or root cause, which can contribute to illness or chronic disease. If you have an imbalance, it can affect your body in many ways. Functional changes occur long before disease is manifested, so functional testing becomes an early warning test for disease which is ideal for prevention-oriented physicians and patients concerned about finding the root cause of their problem.</p>

                        <p>Functional medicine, now also known as Precision Medicine, relies on laboratory diagnostic testing to determine the unique nutritional, toxicological, metabolic, immune, allergic, hormonal, neurotransmitter, infectious and genetic status of each patient, which allows the physician to select appropriate  therapies for the individual. The functional medical physicians use many tests to determine how the body or organ is currently functioning, or working, as compared with normal, healthy functioning, and are skilled in the interpretation of these tests.</p>

                            <h6 class="" style="color: #005596;">Genetic Testing</h6>
                            <p>Our model of Functional Medicine involves special lab diagnostic testing, called Functional Testing. These lab tests are often covered by insurance and help to identify and correct imbalances in the brain and body chemistry. Imbalances such as these may be early symptoms of disease or barriers to good health. Additional factors such as genetic make-up through genetic testing helps to provide accurate, individual information that will change the future of healthcare to personalized medicine.</p>

                        <h6><b>Functional Medicine Treatment to Address the Underlying Causes</b></h6>

                        <p>Finding and correcting the root molecular cause of your illness or imbalance can only improve your outcome.</p>
                        <p>As an example, we offer amino acid precursor therapies which may help restore the imbalanced neurotransmitters that may have caused  or exacerbated conditions such as <a href="#">ADHD</a>, or <a href="#">Addiction</a>to alcohol or substances in the first place. Functional laboratory testing may determine what your specific nutritional and metabolic imbalances and toxicities are, so that your unique "body" or physical causes can be pinpointed and corrected. These amino acid and nutritional therapies can be delivered through nutritional supplements, intravenously and transdermally (through the skin).</p>
                        <p>Degenerative neurologic diseases such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, Multiple Sclerosis, and early Dementia are often an expression of neurotoxicity. This can come from mercury, pesticides, mold, or other toxins. Clearing out the toxic load through a sound program of <a href="#">detoxification</a>is always worthy of consideration.</p>
