                        <p>Good health requires a strong immune system. Intravenous therapy, or IV therapies are available on-site and your physician's option to boost the immune system, replenish vitamins/minerals, boost energy, detoxify harmful metals and chemicals from the body and provide essential nutrients for the body. These services are provided in a comfortable and nurturing environment so you can rest as you receive your treatments.</p>
                        <p>NIHA offers on-site a number of specialty procedures including IV therapies and collects specimens for a wide variety of traditional and national specialty laboratories. Functional lab testing helps your physician to identify the underlying root cause of symptoms in order to diagnose and treat you more effectively. Routine testing may include blood counts and chemistries while specialty labs make kits available that can provide more complex analysis with genetic markers, chronic illnesses and cellular functions. Testing may also include saliva, hair, or urinalysis specimens.</p>

                        <h6>IV Therapies</h6>

                        <h6>What is Intravenous Therapy (IV) and why is it used? </h6>

                        <p>Intravenous therapy (IV) involves giving a nutritional or therapeutic substance directly into a vein in an arm that will quickly enter the circulatory system. Intravenous administration provides a quick, direct and effective method for the body to absorb and utilize therapeutic substances. In some cases when the digestive tract is not properly absorbing nutrients, an IV solution will deliver the needed nutrients, and nutrients can be tolerated at levels thought by the integrative medical community to have therapeutic effects. These therapies can be formulated for specific health challenges, mobilize nutrients into cells by means of a high concentration gradient, and deliver higher doses than by mouth without intestinal irritation or limited absorption due to gastrointestinal disorders.</p>

                        <h6>Benefits of IV Treatment:</h6>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Deliver substances more quickly and more effectively to the body than can oral solutions</li>
                            <li>Correct nutritional and biochemical deficiencies</li>
                            <li>Boost immune function</li>
                            <li>Detoxify and reduce inflammation</li>
                        </ul>


                        <h6>What conditions may benefit from IV Therapy?</h6>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Addictions</li>

                        </ul>

                        <h6>Are these treatments safe? Are there side effects?</h6>

                        <p>Practitioners have been using many of these treatments for many years; your safety is an priority and every effort will be made to ensure your safety. Like any treatment, nutritional and other therapeutic IV's carry some risk.*  Your physician will help you consider the risks and benefits of therapy. It is important to inform your physician of any possible allergies you may have prior to your treatment. Being well hydrated and having a stable glucose level will definitely make the treatment more comfortable. Side effects remain infrequent. All patients are continuously monitored by the Lab staff while getting treatments to provide a safe and comfortable experience.</p>

                        <p>Nutritional and some of the other therapeutic IVs listed here are not widely practiced as part of conventional medicine, but have become a fairly widespread practice among physicians who practice integrative medicine.  Integrative physicians, who incorporate functional, complementary or alternative medical (CAM) approaches into practice, have found that many patients respond well to these IVs. This view is supported by a substantial body of clinical literature and many of these therapies are routinely taught in continuing medical education courses for integrative physicians. The body of evidence for some of these therapies, however, may not be considered sufficiently rigorous by mainstream medical institutions to support the widespread adoption of these practices.</p>

                        <p>The hallmark of an integrative approach to health care is the determination to identify root causes of illness and seek treatments that go beyond symptom relief.  This requires a sophisticated array of tests for blood, urine and other sampling that can provide the diagnostic capacity to "drill down" and evaluate multiple factors simultaneously. NIHA makes a wide array of national lab testing available, and provide numerous specialty blood, urine and other kits, with skilled phlebotomists available to draw, prepare and ship specimens to the numerous labs our practitioners utilize. Additionally, NIHA offers its patients the convenience of having a LabCorp in-house blood draw station.</p>

                        <p>Cortisol, DHEA, estrogen, progesterone and testosterone are some of the key hormones that regulate our physiology and behavior. Specialty labs can identify specific levels of hormones using both blood and saliva.</p>

                        <h6>NUTRITIONAL TESTS</h6>
                        <p>NIHA works with many different laboratories to identify metabolic imbalances that may contribute to underlying chronic conditions. Testing may include core nutrients, antioxidants, B vitamins, digestive support, essential fatty acids, amino acids and minerals. Numerous tests are also available for celiac and gluten sensitivities.</p>

                        <h6>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</h6>
                        <p>NIHA works with laboratories that perform state-of-the-art clinical and research testing for Lyme Disease and co-infections or associated tick-borne diseases, among other infectious agents.</p>

                        <h6>TOXINS</h6>
                        <p>We can become sick after acute or chronic exposure to toxins in our food, homes, outdoors and/or in the personal products we use. Mold, heavy metals (such as mercury) and air pollution are but a few toxins that can make us sick, or prevent us from healing. NIHA physicians offer blood testing to identify a multitude of possible toxins.</p>

                            <h6>Genetic Tests</h6>
                            <p>Genetic testing looks at genes to identify information about hereditary medical conditions (cancer, heart disease, diabetes) in your family and predisposition/ risks for other health concerns such as insomnia and low energy.</p>
                            <p>These genetic tests identify changes in chromosomes, genes or proteins. Genes called SNPs can create vulnerabilities to many kinds of allergic, infectious, immune, toxic, nutritional and psycho-emotional stress. Getting to the genetic root cause provides important data to prevent and treat chronic medical conditions and psychiatric disorders. NIHA offers specialty kits from national labs that will confirm or rule out suspected genetic conditions and risk factors.</p>

                            <p>We offer many useful genetic test panels that help address the whole health picture of the patient such as:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>MTHFR (methylation pathways)
                                </li>
                                <li>BRAC 1/BRAC2 (breast cancer)</li>
                                <li>Pharmacogenetic Testing (PGx), for your unique genetic response to medication.</li>
                                <li>Cardiogenomics for heart risk factors</li>
                                <li>Alpha 1 for AAT deficiency</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p class="mb-3">Genetic tests expose the vulnerabilities but also provide what kind of treatment or preventive measures such as lifestyle and dietary changes should be implemented for long term health and effective treatment.</p>

                            <p style="font-style: italic;">Adverse reactions such as discomfort, swelling and bruising at the injection site, inflammation of the vein, dizziness, feeling faint, or decreased blood sugar or blood pressure during or following some types of treatment. These side effects are generally temporary and resolve quickly, if they occur. There is also a low risk of infection, and while rare, particularly when using nutraceutical products, any infusion into the body has some risk of allergic reaction which can either cause symptoms at the site of the infusion or systemic problems that in very rare cases can be serious.</p>
