            <b>About:</b>
            <p>
                Dr. Cannon comes to NIHA after a 20 year career in 
                academic medicine, and medical education and administration.
                Board-certified in anatomic and clinical pathology, 
                and blood banking/ transfusion medicine, Dr. Cannon worked in 
                student affairs and admissions at the medical school level, 
                guiding, mentoring, and learning from students, from college through 
                entrance to residency training and beyond.

                A long-standing interest in disease prevention, 
                environmental medicine and the integrative approach to diagnosis,
                testing and treatment led her to the preventive 
                medicine program at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, 
                where she learned the population approach to prevention among other 
                topics. Fortunately, the curriculum also included integrative, 
                as well as environmental and occupational medicine; the information 
                dovetailed beautifully with her interests and helped fill in the 
                gaps that remain when 
                addressing populations rather than individuals.
            </p>

            <b>Approach to the Patient:</b>
            <div>
              <p>
                First do no harm, then, do good! Primum non nocere et tunc benefacere, 
                if you prefer Latin.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                We can all benefit from work on our health foundation - the “fundamental lifestyle 
                factors” of functional medicine, which include nutrition, exercise, sleep/rest, 
                stress management and healthy relationships. 
                Prevention is always a goal, no matter how challenging our health may be.

              <p>
                  You are not your “problem list”, and your diagnoses are labels 
                  that usually point to underlying nutritional, 
                  assimilation (digestion and metabolism), 
                  structural, environmental, genetic, behavioral, physical, hormonal, 
                  energetic and/or spiritual issues that will respond, when correctly 
                  identified and treated. 
                  Finding the root cause(s) of your health issue is a tenet 
                  of integrative medicine.
              </p>

              <p>
                  My special interests include the damaging effects of 
                  environmental exposures and toxins and their roles in autoimmune, 
                  inflammatory, infectious, cardiovascular and other chronic diseases. 
                  I follow with great interest, any developments regarding the health 
                  effects of pesticides, heavy metals, nanoscale materials 
                  (as found in personal care products and cosmetics, for example) 
                  and genetically engineered foods. 
                  Finally, the explosion of 
                  the ‘omics (microbiomics, genomics and epigenomics, etc.) and their 
                  roles in precision medicine will hopefully be areas of focus that 
                  I can bring to bear on the health of 
                  patients through the internal environment, or “milieu”.
