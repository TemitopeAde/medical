          <b>About:</b>
            <p>
              Dr. Gant is an author, teacher and most of all practitioner 
              who provides innovative and personal care for his patients. 
              Charles Gant MD, PhD, has practiced functional and integrative 
              medicine, and mindfulness-based cognitive psychotherapy for nearly 
              four decades. He has incorporated Precision Medicine into his practice
              in the last decade. Precision medicine is an innovative approach to 
              disease prevention and treatment that takes into account individual
              differences in 
              genomics, environmental stressors, and lifestyles.

            <p>
              Several decades of practicing functional 
              and causal medicine has led me on a journey to ever deepening discoveries 
              of the root causes of both wellness and disease. The question has always 
              been for me, and I ask this now of you; exactly what nutritional deficiency, 
              toxin, metabolic defect, infection, allergy, neurotransmitter or hormonal 
              imbalance, psycho-emotional conflict and/or genetic predisposition do I/you 
              NOT want to know about, that could be contributing to or causing your symptoms 
              and problems? For me the answer has always been; I want to know about every one 
              that I can test for and address in a rational way, and this is why I routinely 
              test for hundreds of risk factors and spend a great deal of time piecing together 
              the unique biochemistry of each patient. I am not comfortable with not knowing 
              and guessing and I am not satisfied until I can find the answers. My faith in 
              science compels me to believe that medical and psychiatric disorders “don’t 
              just happen,” that magical forces don’t make people sick, and that causes 
              for many disorders can be found if our technology is up to the task and I 
              can be diligent enough to find the answers.
               My motto has always been, “If you don’t test, you’ve guessed.”
            </p>

            <p>
              Decades into this journey, I now find it hard to 
              imagine how many chronic medical or psychiatric disorders 
              could not be eliminated or at least significantly modified, if one 
              embarks on a thorough search through the 1000’s of potentially causal 
              nutritional, immune, infectious, allergic, psycho-emotional, metabolic, 
              energetic, hormonal and genetic risk factors, followed by precisely targeted 
              treatments designed to address each causal risk factor. It does not matter 
              what other kind of healthcare treatment you use, integrative, holistic, 
              psychotherapeutic or conventional, or what kind of medical or psychiatric 
              challenge you face. 
              Finding and correcting the root molecular causes can only improve your outcomes.
