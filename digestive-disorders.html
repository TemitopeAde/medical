                        <h4>Digestive Health & G.I. Disorders</h4>
                        
                        <p>
                            Hippocrates, said,  “All disease begins in the gut," 
                            and modern medical research has proven he was largely correct. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Good digestive health is critical to optimal health. An unhealthy gut can be a significant contributor to inflammatory conditions such as gastrointestinal disorders, chronic pain, poor immune health and disease. It can slow down energy, 
                            hamper mental focus and affects overall health, including emotional and mental wellbeing. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Approximately 80% of the immune system is located in the gut. The gut 
                            acts as an engine to power and sustain the rest of the body.
                             The immune system determines who will get sick and who will stay well. 
                             Researchers are studying changes in gut bacteria that are seen in Parkinson’s,
                              irritable bowel syndrome, diabetes and obesity.  
                            A strong and functioning immune system strengthens your resistance to virus, infections and disease.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h6>If digestive health is not optimum, other G.I. disorders can occur such as:</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li><a>Leaky Gut</a></li>
                            <li><a>Constipation & Bloating</a></li>

                            Maintaining proper balance and diversity of healthy flora is key, 
                            but the gut microbiome is a complex ecosystem affected by many 
                            factors. Understanding the gut microbiome and the balance between
                             “good bugs” and “bad bugs” is an essential 
                            piece to good overall health and an area of expertise for integrative physicians.
                        </p>
                        
                        <div>
                            <h6>What Determines Gut Health?</h6>
                            <h6 class="mt-3">

                            <p>
                                A significant factor in the health of the "soil" in our gut microbiome 
                                is the food we eat. Consuming high amounts of refined sugars, processed
                                 foods, preservatives, refined flours, and genetically modified food (GMO's)
                                  put a burden on the body and tend to increase
                                 inflammation in the gut and contribute to Leaky gut, Candida and other digestive disorders.
                            </p>

                            <h6>Genetics</h6>
                            <p>
                                <a href="#">Food allergies or sensitivities </a>
                                can be a major contributor to gastrointestinal disturbances. A
                                 simple food sensitivity test can determine if this has been a factor 
                                 in producing poor health. Signs of a food allergy
                                 include brain fog or fatigue after eating, gas, bloating or skin reactions such as hives.
                            </p>

                            <h6>Medication</h6>
                            <p>
                                Overuse of antibiotics can cause harmful changes in the gut microflora 
                                and result in destroying both bad and good bacteria. Any medication 
                                prescriptions or even over-the-counter pain relievers with aspirin 
                                or acetaminophen irritate the intestinal lining and decrease mucosal
                                 levels, the protective barrier in the intestines. This can cause an inflammatory
                                 cycle (more bacteria, yeast, and digestion issues) and promote an increase in gut permeability.
                            </p>

                            <h6>Chronic Stress</h6>
                            <p>
                                Chronic stress tends to create a suppressed immune function, which is more
                                 easily overrun with pathogens. This increases overall gut inflammation,
                                  leading to increased permeability of the intestines and insufficient levels
                                   of digestive enzymes and stomach acid leading to poor "soil" in the gut. 
                                   This creates a vicious cycle,
                                 leaving a person unable to digest the very nutrients that they need to restore their health.
                            </p>

                            <h6>Candida (Yeast)</h6>
                            <p>
                                <a href="#">Yeast, or Candida</a>
                                is found in normal gut flora but can proliferate with high consumption of sugars
                                 and refined carbohydrates and antibiotic use. Candida can coat the intestines and
                                  may cause its own holes in the lining. Patients with an overabundance of Candida tend to have 
                                symptoms of brain fog, fatigue, difficulty with digestion, and often acne, among many other symptoms.
                            </p>

                            <h6>Zinc Deficiency</h6>
                            <p>
                                Zinc is involved in maintaining a strong intestinal lining. A deficiency of zinc can lead to the mucosal lining losing strength and becoming more permeable. Just supplementing with zinc when it is deficient can dramatically improve intestinal lining integrity.
                            </p>

                            <h6>Restore Gut Health with the 4 R’s</h6>
                            <p>An acronym for healing the digestive system is sometimes described as the 4 R’s.</p>

                            <div class="mt-1">
                                <h6>1 REMOVE</h6>
                                <p>Removal of the offending flora, junk food, allergenic foods (wheat and dairy are common), mercury fillings, and toxic chemicals. Diagnostic testing for food sensitivities, stool, urine or blood work are sometimes needed to determine what the unfriendly flora is and what herbals and antibiotics remove it. <a href="#"> Colon hydrotherapy</a>can be very helpful in the removal process.  </p>
                            </div>

                                <p>
                                    Replace digestive enzymes.  As we age, and especially if there have been any 
                                    chronic health issues or EPI (Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency), the digestive
                                     enzymes and hydrochloric acid produced in the stomach is diminished. 
                                     Supplementing with digestive enzymes helps food get broken down into absorbable elements.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                <p>Re-innoculate the good flora by reseeding with probiotics. Probiotics are products containing living beneficial bacteria, i.e., "good bugs", which colonize the entire lining of our intestine. Fermented foods such as kefir, kimchi, sauerkraut contain natural probiotics.</p>
                            </div>

                            <div class="mt-1">

                                <p>Repair the lining of the intestines, healing the “leaky gut” or microscopic holes that allowed food to leak through and challenge the immune system.  The lining of the intestines is the line of defense between your immune system and unfriendly flora and toxins. Some foods help to naturally repair the gut lining include prebiotics, probiotics, fermented foods, homemade stocks, l-glutamine and aloe vera.</p>
                            </div>

                            <p>As your gut health improves, inflammation decreases, and you may find that chronic pain and illnesses start to improve. It is also likely that your energy, mood, sleep and mental focus will improve.</p>
