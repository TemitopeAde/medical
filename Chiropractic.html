                            Chiropractors are trained to ensure your nervous system functions properly. 
                            The head and spine are the first areas of your nervous system that 
                            can become irritated and inflamed causing pain, numbness, tingling,
                             and burning. Chiropractors use manipulations to the spine and joints
                              of the body to free up these entrapments and to restore your body to proper health. This
                             allows for proper motion of these joints so that you can move like you were designed to move.

                            <h6>Chiropractic manipulation</h6>
                            <p>
                                Chiropractic manipulation refers to a chiropractor applying
                                 manipulation to the vertebrae and joints of the body that
                                  have abnormal movement patterns or fail to function normally. 
                                  A manipulation is a thrust that is applied to the joint.
                                   Manipulation typically has an accompanying, 
                                   audible release of gas (joint cavitation) that is 
                                   caused by the release of oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon 
                                   dioxide, which releases joint pressure. There is a relieving
                                    sensation most of the time, although minor discomfort may occur if the surrounding 
                                muscles are in spasm or the patient tenses up during this chiropractic care.

                                Chiropractic manipulation (also known as chiropractic adjustment or 
                                spinal manipulation), is a common therapeutic treatment 
                                for a variety of physical pain and physical health conditions.

                                The objective of this chiropractic treatment is to restore normal function
                                 to the spine and all other areas that contribute
                                  to physical dysfunction. This results in an
                                 increased range of motion reduced nerve irritability and improved function.

                                ART is most commonly used to treat conditions related

                                applied to restore function of that area and decrease pain. Specific 
                                conditions that can be treated with ART include headaches, back pain, 
                                carpal tunnel syndrome other peripheral nerve entrapments, shin splints,
