                        <p>Recovery from substance abuse disorders and addictions is 
                            usually referred to as a recovery of mind, body and spirit.

                            This also describes precisely the Integrative Medicine approach to any physical or mental disorder 
                            provided by NIHA. We focus on recovery of your overall well being.
                        </p>
                        <p>Therapies and lifestyle changes for addiction are not 
                            meant to take the place of  traditional addiction 
                            treatment or peer support groups like AA. Rather,  integrative and holistic addiction therapies are adjunctive and intended to support the body as it recovers, and
                             complement and enhance the benefits of conventional addiction treatment and support groups.
                        </p>
                        <p>Therapies such as acupuncture, meditation, massage,
                             biofeedback and nutritional therapy are meant
                             to support the body, replace what is needed, relieve stress and help restore energy.
                        </p>
                        <p>Addictions can be to Alcohol, Tobacco, Illicit Substances,
                             or Prescription Drugs. Our country now sees addiction to 
                             painkillers and opioids as a national epidemic. And when 
                             there is an addict in the family the whole family suffers.  
                             When a loved one is suffering from an addiction, the stress
                              of that relationship (co-dependency) can be at the root of
                             other medical or emotional issues as the family experiences the stress and chaos of addiction
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Generally speaking, if you are a recovering person looking for help, 
                            you find assistance for a recovery of mind and spirit- but not for 
                            supporting the body. You may find adjunctive treatments like acupuncture, 
                            but few resources are available to assist you in the natural
                             regeneration of neurotransmitters like serotonin, or to assist in 
                            detoxifying your body from the residual toxins left over from the use of drugs and alcohol.

                        <h4>Holistic & Integrative Addiction Therapies 
                            for Detoxification & Recovery of the Body 
                        </h4>
                        <p>We can help you replace this missing link in recovery- a 
                            recovery of the body. For instance, we offer amino acid 
                            precursor therapies to help restore the imbalanced
                             neurotransmitters that may have contributed to substance
                              or alcohol use or abuse in the first place. These amino acid
                               and nutritional therapies can be delivered
                             through nutritional supplements, intravenously and transdermally (through the skin).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We also offer detoxification therapies such as ion footbath and colonic treatments,
                             IV's and other detoxification treatments to help cleanse the body.
                              We can provide laboratory testing prior to treatment to determine
                               what your specific nutritional and metabolic imbalances and 
                               toxicities are, and help replace what is needed in the body.
                                 Many addicts are have a poor diet and may be deficient in 
                                 vitamins and minerals and need help to develop a nutritious diet and healthy eating routine.
                             Laboratory testing will be recommended to determine any underlying biochemical imbalances.
                        </p>
                        <p>All addiction therapies at NIHA are medically supervised and are adjunctive treatments.
                             They are not meant to take the place of conventional addiction treatment
                              or peer support groups like AA. We are not a treatment center,
                               but an integrative medical center that may provide therapies to 
                            complement and enhance the benefits of conventional addiction treatment and support groups.

                        <h6>Educational Materials</h6>
                        <p>At the core of any Integrative Medicine therapy is patient education.
                             This information emphasizes how to help recovery using 
                             nutritional therapies to regenerate the "feel good" 
                             natural, brain hormone neurotransmitters, such as 
                             serotonin, GABA, endorphins and dopamine. Once these are regenerated, symptoms such as cravings, mood swings, compulsive behaviors, insomnia,
                             anxiety and low moods often are lessened as the body is restored to a more balanced state.
