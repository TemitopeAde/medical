                        <h4>Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome CIRS</h4>

                        <p>
                            Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS) is a collection of symptoms
                             which is also sometimes referred to as Biotoxin Illness, or Mold Illness,
                              and was initially thought to be caused by mold exposure only. However, 
                              further research indicates bacteria, fungus and various viral 
                            infections are also implicated in the development of Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome.

                            It is quite a dilemma for both patients and physicians in dealing
                             with such a complex illness as CIRS,  which overlaps and can mimic
                              symptoms associated with other conditions such as  Lyme Disease, 
                              Ehrlichiosis and some  
                            Auto Immune Disorders. CIRS may often be misdiagnosed, or under diagnosed.

                        <p>
                            Visual Contrast Sensitivity Testing, commonly known as Visual 
                            Contrast Testing, was originally developed by the U.S. 
                            Military Medical Services as a visual assessment for jet
                             fighter pilots. It is a testing measure for the ability 
                             to see details at variable contrast levels of grey. While
                              in fact it is a nonspecific test of neurological immune functional assessment-
                             it is found to possess a high degree of accuracy and sensitivity for biotoxin exposure.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Visual contrast ability is impaired in most CIRS sufferers whereby 
                            over 90% of them fail a simple VCS test. VCS testing provides an initial 
                            indication of whether CIRS is a likely diagnosis, although it cannot confirm or rule out CIRS.
