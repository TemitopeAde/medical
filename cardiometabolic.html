                        <h4>Cardiometabolic Disease Program</h4>
                    
                        <p>
                            Cardiometabolic Disease is a constellation of health issues 
                            involving metabolic dysfunction and cardiovascular conditions.
                              Cardiometabolic disease is characterized by cardiovascular 
                              issues such as heart attack, stroke, angina, high blood
                               pressure and disorders of the vascular system, and
                                metabolic disorders that occur together including obesity, 
                            diabetes, insulin resistance, abdominal adiposity 
                            (belly fat), and impaired glucose tolerance.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Cardiometabolic disease is common in middle and older 
                            generations and other names used for cardiometabolic 
                            diseases are cardiometabolic syndrome (CMS), metabolic
                             syndrome, insulin resistance, syndrome X, or beer belly 
                             syndrome. Metabolic Syndrome is a collection of symptoms 
                             which include abdominal obesity (waistline 40 inches or
                              more in men, 35 inches or more in women), 
                              high triglycerides, low “good” HDL cholesterol
                             and high blood pressure and is a major contributor
                              to increased risk for cardiometabolic syndrome.
                        </p>

                        <h6>High Risk for a Cardiac Event or Diabetes</h6>
                        <p>According to Jos Ordovs, PhD, director of the Nutrition 
                            and Genomics Research Lab at Tufts’ HNRCA, “When two or
                             more of these risk factors coexist, it doubles the risk 
                             of heart attack and stroke and increases the risk of
                              diabetes by a factor of 5 (both over a period of 5 to
                               10 years). Some experts have proposed additional 
                               cardiometabolic risk factors, including high levels of C-reactive protein
                             in the blood, a marker of 
                            chronic inflammation thought to contribute to cardiovascular disease.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Risk factors allow doctors and researchers to identify 
                            individuals who may be at risk of more serious cardiometabolic 
                            diseases and take corrective action. If you have risk factors
                             for cardiometabolic disease, the first step
                             is to institute changes in lifestyle, such as losing weight and eating a healthier diet.” 
                        </p>
                        <p>Around 25% of 
                            the world's adults are suffering from cardiometabolic syndrome 
                            and it is now a global health issue.

                        <h4>Functional Medicine Treatment to Lower Risk Factors of Cardiometabolic Syndrome</h4>
                        
                       <p>
                        The first step is to meet with an MD to assess your current 
                        cardiovascular and metabolic status. The goal of this 
                        personalized program is to reduce or eliminate the major 
                        risk factors that are contributing to cardiometabolic disease. 
                        After a thorough medical evaluation, the physician will make 
                        recommendations for the patient to work on with the support 
                        of a wellness coach, to encourage effective and long-term lifestyle changes.
                       </p>

                       <h6>Lifestyle</h6>
                       <p>
                            Management of cardiometabolic disease may be accomplished with 
                            a combination of diet, exercise, medication and detoxification. A sedentary lifestyle, 
                            poor diet, poor stress management or lack or physical exercise are lifestyle factors to correct.
                       </p>

                        <p>
                        Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Metabolic disorders are chronic 
                        systemic inflammatory conditions. The bowel and liver are always 
                        involved in CVD, Metabolic diseases and all other chronic systemic 
                        inflammatory conditions. Inflammation can be reduced by identifying 
                        and addressing the root cause of inflammation such as diet,
                            infection, allergies, etc. and improving the health of the bowel and liver.

                             which regulate heartbeat, heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, 
                             respiration, saliva, urine, digestion of food, and balancing glandular
