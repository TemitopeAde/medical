                            As obesity is not caused by a single factor, there is not a single solution.

                            Weight loss is determined by the interaction of one’s unique physiology and the environmental influences that are acting upon it.

                            NIHA'S Weight Loss Program uses a personalized functional medicine approach with lab testing, nutrition, pharmacology and other assessment tools to determine what your unique requirements are for weight loss.
                        </p>

                        <p>Dr. Tapscott is a diplomate of the American Board of Obesity Medicine (ABOM) and has developed and directed several hospital affiliated medical and surgical weight loss programs. She is a member of the Obesity Medicine Association, and has spent the last 12 years helping thousands of DC area residents achieve successful weight loss and reduce their disease burden, resulting in healthier lives.</p>
                        

                        <h6 class="mt-3">Factors in Obesity and Overweight</h6>
                        <p>There are many potential factors contributing to obesity and overweight. Some of which include: Poor diets with insufficient high quality nutrients and excessive calorie dense foods and beverages, stress, lack of quality sleep, sedentary lifestyle, hormonal imbalances and an unhealthy gut microbiome. See the complete list:</p>

                        <h6>What is Obesity</h6>

                        <p>“Obesity is defined as a chronic, relapsing, multi-factorial, neurobehavioral disease, wherein an increase in body fat promotes adipose tissue dysfunction and abnormal fat mass physical forces, resulting in adverse metabolic, biomechanical, and psychosocial health consequences.” Obesity Medical Association</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>60% of Americans are overweight or obese.</li>
                            <li>For those who are obese, health-care costs are almost $1,500 more per person per year than someone of healthy weight.</li>
                            <li>Fat cells produce chemicals that initiate a cascade of inflammatory processes throughout the body.</li>
                            <li>Metabolically obese normal weight patients, i.e.,  “skinny fat” express metabolic diseases typically associated with those with increased body fat.</li>

                            <h6 style="font-style: .9rem;">WHAT TO EXPECT with a MEDICAL WEIGHT LOSS PROGRAM</h6>
                            <p>The functional medicine approach complements all the traditional tests and uses additional advanced assessment tools to gain more detailed information in order to plan the best personalized treatments based on the individual’s needs. Because this program is medically supervised, Dr. Tapscott is a partner with you on your weight loss journey.</p>

                            <h6 style="font-style: .9rem;">1. Comprehensive History</h6>
                            <p>The first step is to gather the patient’s history as far back as in utero to better understand the antecedents, triggers and mediators of the disease process. This can often times be done electronically in advance of the appointment. Anthropometrics and biomarkers are evaluated using the latest technology and clinical indicators helping to create a complete picture of one’s health.</p>

                            <h6 style="font-style: .9rem;">2. Modification of Lifestyle Factors</h6>
                            <p>Addressing modifiable lifestyle factors (sleep, movement, stress, relationships, and diet) early on is fundamental to the success of the patient. At NIHA, we have a team of specialists to help provide such support when needed.</p>

                            <h6 style="font-style: .9rem;">3. Advanced Laboratory Testing</h6>
                            <p>Additional advanced laboratory assessments will further explore the “true health” status of the patient. This testing can reveal nutritional, metabolic, hormonal, and genetic factors playing a role in the disease process. Individualized diagnostic testing may also be recommended based on comorbidities.</p>

                            <h6 style="font-style: .9rem;">4. A Personalized Treatment Plan</h6>
                            <p>Treatment plans ALL consist of dietary protocols and supplements tailored to the patient based on the above findings. This may include meal oriented intermittent fasting, elimination diets, or cardiometabolic meal plans to name a few. Some patients may also benefit from IV nutritional therapy and/or chelation treatments. Appetite can be managed with medical and non-medical interventions after determining the contributing factors.</p>


                            <h6 style="font-style: .9rem;">5. Monitoring Progress</h6>

                            <p>Routine follow up is important to monitor success and make changes in the treatment protocols when necessary.

                                As patients’ health status improves it may become necessary to adjust current medication. We work in collaboration with patient’s primary care to keep them informed of their progress and to refer them for additional medical tests and assessments.</p>
