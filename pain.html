                        <p>Pain is the #1 reason people go to the doctor, and one of the top reasons they seek out an integrati practitioner.   </p>
                        <p>Pain is a symptom, or effect of something wrong. For effective resolution of pain, treatment should be directed at the root cause. </p>
                        <p>Integrative Medicine strategies for chronic pain can be very effective. An integrative medicine approach requires the patient be actively engaged encouraging a reciprocal relationship with the doctor. Integrative Medicine views that the body is usually self-healing; the doctor merely helps remove the blocks and enhances the process. This is the miracle of healing.</p>
                        <p>For acute pain, we offer chiropractic treatment, massage, laser, acupuncture, cupping and more, which can be very effective. Chronic pain requires more investigation into the source of pain.</p>

                        <h4>An Integrative, Holistic Approach to Chronic Pain</h4>
                        <p>There are two ways to approach chronic pain.</p>
                        <p>One is to treat the symptoms (temporarily cover it) and the other is to treat the root cause (fix it).</p>
                        <p>For effective resolution of pain, treatment should be directed at fixing the root cause.  When the root cause of pain is properly addressed, the symptoms often disappear. The symptoms may appear as muscle/joint pain, fatigue, headache or other dysfunction. The actual problem may be infection, nutritional, structural, or toxicity.</p>
                        <p>Integrative doctors look at the whole body to locate the cause of pain. Pain may be local, but can often be referred; that is, your knee pain may be a symptom of something else going on in your body, like a back problem or a chronic dental infection. The knee may hurt but the source of the pain may be elsewhere.The mind/body connection may need to be addressed as part of your healing.</p>
                        <p>The best treatment plan may be a multi-faceted approach integrative approach and incorporate therapies to address the cause of pain on a physical, spiritual, and emotional level. Integrative medicine incorporates the use of drugs and surgery when appropriate but also strives to understand the  root cause of the pain and facilitate natural healing.</p>


                        <h6>A Multi-faceted Approach to Find and Treat the Root Cause of Pain</h6>

                        <p>Integrative Medicine has developed successful models to navigate efficient and effective treatment strategies to treat the many painful conditions. Pain is a threshold problem that typically involves more than one component, listed below, and usually all four when the problem is complex. Multiple therapies directed at only one component usually net a poorer result and is ultimately more costly. The physician can assess, coordinate and treat all four components of chronic pain simultaneously.</p>

                        <h6 style="font-weight: 0.9rem;">Initial Evaluation</h6>
                        <p>A thorugh initial evaluation may include a complete history and clinical evaluation, lab work, <a href="#">functional assessments and testing</a>, and a <a href="#">chiropractic evaluation</a> to determine the contributing causes of pain. We assess the four components of pain, which can be addressed simultaneously for optimal efficiency and effectiveness.</p>

                        <h6 style="font-weight: 0.9rem;">Physical/Structural Component </h6>
                        <p>There is often a physical or structural issue contributing to pain which relates to the muscles, joints, ligaments, bones and other connective tissues. A chiropractic or dental evaluation may be necessary.</p>

                        <h6 style="font-weight: 0.9rem;">Metabolic/ Biochemical /Immunological Component</h6>
                        <p>hese processes may enhance or supplement biochemical, metabolic and immunological reactions in the body. They can also suppress healing if not functioning properly.

                            Is there an allergic or immunological response? Is inflammation a chronic issue?</p>

                        <h6 style="font-weight: 0.9rem;">Neurological or Electro-magnetic Component</h6>
                        <p>What is the status of the autonomic nervous system, the energetic, functional nervous system which regulates the biochemical reactions of the cells and physical structures of the body?</p>

                        <h6 style="font-weight: 0.9rem;">Psycho-emotional, Mental, Bio-energetic Component</h6>
                        <p>Pain may have an emotional, spiritual, mind/body connection to healing on the many different levels. Has there been trauma or extreme stress contributing to physical or emotional pain?</p>
