                            Chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromylagia are conditions that are often 
                            associated with each other. Chronic fatigue syndrome is characterized by
                             excessive fatigue, poor sleep, headaches, anxiety, depression, poor memory,
                              irritable bowel syndrome, and lowered immune function. Fibromyalgia
                               is associated with diffuse muscle and/or joint pain. Both are often 
                               associated with allergies and chemical sensitivities. People suffering
                                with chronic fatigue  may have a compromised immune system with chronic 
                                sinus infections, sore throats, and tender lymph nodes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are no diagnostic tests to confirm chronic fatigue and 
                            fibromyalgia. A diagnosis is often reached after other conditions
                             have been ruled out and is based 
                            on the patientâ€™s collection of symptoms. Patients often suffer for years with the illness.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We do not know for sure what causes chronic fatigue 
                            syndrome and fibromyalgia. Research suggests these conditions 
                            may be the result of infection, trauma, adrenal or thyroid 
                            dysfunction, sleep or endocrine disorders, or chronic stress. There is usually 
                            an association with low body temperatures and low metabolic function.

                    <div class="mt-3">
                        <h4>Holistic Treatment for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Fibromyalgia</h4>
                        
                        <p>
                            While we do not know what causes these conditions, we do know that underlying 
                            unhealthy conditions may contribute to the symptoms. The physician can assess
                             your current health status by blood work, tests for heavy metals, mineral and
                              vitamin deficiencies, candida (yeast infection),
                             food/environmental/chemical allergies or sensitivities, 
                             digestive disorders, and endocrine disorders.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We then develop a treatment plan which incorporates traditional and
                             complementary and alternative therapies such as I.V. nutritional 
                             support, supplements, detoxification, adrenal and thyroid support, 
                             amino acid therapies, massage, integrative manual therapy, 
                             stress management, and dietary guidelines. Using a multitude
                              of tools, the treatment plan will correct a deficiencies,
                             support the whole body, and help you manage your condition with restored health and energy.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The vast majority of patients we see with Chronic fatigue syndrome
                             (CFS) and Fibromyalgia respond well to the integrative, holistic approach
                              even when they have not responded to conventional (drug oriented)
                               medicine. Part of the reason patients respond is because we get to the root 
                            cause of many problems and have more complementary and alternative therapy tools to use.
