                        <h4>Autism Spectrum Disorder</h4>
                        <p>Autism is a complex developmental disorder that typically 
                            appears during the first three years of life,
                             impacting development in all areas, 
                             especially social interaction and communication skills. Autism is a 
                            spectrum disorder, meaning that it can
                             manifest itself in forms ranging from mild to severe.</p>
                        <p>The autism spectrum looks like this:</p>

                        <p>
                            Autism, or autism spectrum disorder, is a wide range of 
                            developmental disorders that affect the nervous system. 
                            The most recent statistics show that 1 in 68 children in the United States have an autism spectrum disorder. That affects over 3 million children.
                             An estimated 1 in 42 boys are diagnosed in the U.S., compared with 1 out of 189 girls.(1) 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Autism is a complex disorder which impairs social and communication skills.
                             The symptoms of autism are thought to be permanent, but current research 
                             shows that a variety of interventions may help children with overcoming 
                             social, communication and developmental challenges faced by children with 
                             autism. There is a wide spectrum of approaches to autism. The integrative
                              medical approach to autism spectrum disorders is to address the underlying
                               multi-factorial causes which may contribute to the child’s condition. 
                            The following areas form the basis of a biomedical testing and treatment approach. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Detailed history and physical,

                                 On the other hand, diet rich in berries, green leafy 
                                vegetables, seeds, and nut butters may reduce inflammation and help cognitive function.

                              My recommended charge to parents of children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum
                               Disorder, is to find what is unique, precious and special about your child. 
                               Autism is not a condition that should be viewed as fixable or reversed.  
                               Set attainable goals.  Change negative perspectives and outlooks for your
                                child. Avoid “guilt parenting” . Try not to question “What is wrong with
                                 my child?” but ask “What is different about my child and how can I,
                                  as his parent, help develop these challenging differences into success? “ 
                                   It is important to have an organized approach to the multi-factorial root
                                    causes for the overall condition, which along with a community of practitioners, 
                            specialists, and modalities…like those of us here at NIHA… will assist you in this journey.
