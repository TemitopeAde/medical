                        <p>
                            If you are diagnosed with cancer there are supportive treatments 
                            which may enhance the body’s ability to fight cancer and help the
                             conventional cancer treatments work more effectively. NIHA's
                              integrative physicians view cancer as a metabolic and genetic
                               disease which has developed over time. Integrative, holistic
                                medicine combines conventional and adjunctive complementary 
                                treatments to restore the patient to a better state of health
                                 and improve the quality of life. Whereas conventional medicine
                                  will focus on treating the tumor,
                             the holistic approach to cancer treatment is to focus on the patient and outcome.
                        </p>
                        <p>The NIHA physician works in conjunction with the patient's conventional
                             cancer treatment for necessary surgery, radiation, chemotherapy
                              and immunotherapy, then places the focus on supporting the
                               patient with safe, adjunctive therapies. The integrative
                                physician provides complementary, supportive and specific
                                 therapies customized to each patient's needs to enhance 
                                 the body's innate ability to heal and gain better quality
                                  of life while undergoing treatment. The patient is an active
                                   participant in the healing process. From the first visit, 
                                   we work together with you to develop a 
                            plan. NIHA treats people with complementary therapies who are undergoing cancer treatment.

                        <h6>Changing the Internal Environment</h6>
                        <p>
                            Integrative medical treatment focuses on the patient -- spirit, mind and body. 
                            The focus of treatment is to change the internal environment (internal milieu) 
                            of the body from one that promotes cancer growth to one that promotes healing 
                            and supports healthy cells. 
                            It fights the tumor from within by activating the immune system and starving the cancer.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This approach helps address the root cause(s) of  illness where possible,
                             and uses effective, intelligent strategies to disarm the
                             growing cancer and the multiple components that perpetuate its unrelenting growth.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We believe that cancer is in essence a metabolic illness. 
                            In the right metabolic circumstances it is able to take hold
                             in the body. If these metabolic conditions are maintained or 
                             enhanced, the cancer will not only continue to live, but grow
                              and overcome the body’s inherent defenses. In our model of 
                              cancer treatment and support, we attempt to halt, 
                            interrupt, and even reverse these processes. The main ways that we do this include:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Starve the cancer while supporting the nutritional needs of the rest of the body</li>
                            <li>Inhibit the cancer</li>
                            <li>Detoxify the body</li>
                            <li>Oxygenate the tissues of the body to shut down the cancer</li>
                            <li>Improve the immune system function so the body can better fight the cancer</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p style="font-style: italic;" class="mb-3 mt-3">
                            Please note that while NIHA physicians and staff have training 
                            and experience in cancer management and treatment, they are not
                             oncologists; NIHA will actively coordinate its services with a 
                             patient’s oncologist and other treating

                            <p>
                                Cancer affects the individual on many levels and is a 
                                multi-factorial and complex disease. We consider many 
                                factors to be important in the treatment of 
                                cancer and a thorough assessment or “complete picture of
                                 the patient” is an essential first step.
                            </p>
                            <p>Cancer develops over time, so the treatment strategy is
                                 based on addressing possible underlying health issues
                                  which may have contributed to the development of disease. 
                                  Factors such as toxic chemicals, immune system issues, 
                                  chronic infections, nutrient imbalances or deficiencies, stress, and unresolved 
                                psycho-emotional issues need to be assessed and considered in treating the whole person.

                                 relates to your cancer diagnosis and treatment, especially
                                  pathology reports, conventional laboratory test results 
                                  and imaging studies. A whole body physical and functional 
                                  evaluation will be conducted during the first visit.
                                   Additional specialty laboratory tests and functional evaluation 
                                will be provided to identify treatable root causes and to correct underlying pathology.

                                training and experience in cancer management and treatment, 
                                they are not oncologists; NIHA will actively coordinate its

                                treating physicians to ensure patients have an active team supporting their care.

                                "Dr. Gant saved my husband's life. He faced a terminal 
                                diagnosis of stage 4 melanoma. Even though we were given 
                                no hope by other very reputable oncology doctors, Dr Gant 
                                spent countless hours with us to determine the biological 
                                cause of cell mutation and developed a treatment plan that
                                 worked. We are forever grateful 
                                to Dr. Gant and the team at NIHA who tirelessly helped our family." M.D. 2018
