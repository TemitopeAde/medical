                        <h4>Anti-Aging Medicine</h4>
                        <p>Aging is a natural process. However, the food we eat, 
                            our lifestyle, stress, where we live and work, and our 
                            relationships all influence our immune system 
                            and thus how healthy we are and how rapidly we age.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div>
                        <!-- <img class="mb-2 mt-2" src="https://www.nihadc.com/images/couple_antiaging_.jpeg" alt=""> -->
                        <p>
                            Although life expectancy has increased dramatically,
                             the quality of life in the aging population has 
                             seriously declined. Eighty percent of people over 
                             the age of 65 have at least one chronic condition 
                             such as heart disease, diabetes, 
                            high blood pressure, high cholesterol or arthritis,
                             and over 50% have more than one chronic condition.

                        <h6>Our Bodies Are Challenged</h6>
                        <p>
                            Our bodies are all challenged by the enormous changes in 
                            our environment: pollution,  reduced soil quality and food 
                            lacking in nutrients, artificial fertilizers, pesticides, 
                            fungicides and preservatives, and farm animal diets, 
                            supplemented by antibiotics and hormones  and loaded with
                             thousands of chemicals that were unknown on the planet 50
                              years ago. In addition, we are besieged by indoor chemical
                               pollution (electromagnetic frequencies EMFs from cell phones, 
                               wireless devices, routers) and heavy metal poisons such as lead, 
                               mercury, cadmium and aluminum - all of which can overload our metabolic
                             processes for detoxification, and trigger free radical reactions 
                             that damage our organs and our genes.
                        </p>
                        <p>As we age, toxins can accumulate in our bodies.
                             While our body does rid itself of many toxins 
                             naturally, as we age and the toxic burden increases,
                             it gets harder and harder to detoxify naturally 
                             and may increase the risk for disease.
                        </p>

                        <h6>Testing the Markers of Aging
                        </h6>
                        
                        <p>
                            Senescence - the process of aging - is accompanied by a "loss
                             of organ reserve capacity" throughout the body. 
                             Muscles weaken, glands reduce secretions, 
                             digestion is impaired (further reducing one's nutritional state),
                              memory and concentration decline, and sexual functions diminish.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Senescence should be approached at the cellular level,
                             with lab tests including various
                             tests that include assessment of the factors listed. Most tests can be done at NIHA's <a href="#">on-site lab.</a>

                        <p>A good assessment will allow the physician to do
                             an individualized rejuvenation plan that
                              will address the different areas that need to be addressed.
