                        <p>Thermography is a painless, non-compressive, 
                            non invasive, state-of-the-art clinical test of 
                            physiology without any exposure to radiation. This test 
                            visualizes heat and activity vs. mass and structure.
                             It is used as part of an early detection program 
                             which gives individuals the opportunity to increase
                              their chances of visualizing an abnormality at an early 
                              stage. It is a valuable risk assessment tool 
                            for alerting your doctor to abnormal patterns that may indicate early stage disease.
                        </p>

                    <div>
                        <h6>Body Thermography</h6>
                        <p>This thermographic screening can help determine functional patterns
                             (such as thyroid function or autonomic immune function) pain,
                              circulation and areas of inflammation. A thermogram of 
                              inflamed areas such as arthritis, back or carotid artery
                               may be helpful to determine severity. Screenings are 
                               also helpful to visualize breast health, digestive issues, dental issues, sinus conditions and unexplained occurrences that other tests have a hard time determining. We are able to screen the full body (head to toe), or upper body (from the pelvis up), or specific area
                             of interest such as knee, abdomen, wrist etc. in addition to the breast thermography.
                        </p>

                        <h6>Breast Thermography</h6>
                        <p>Breast Thermography can detect vascularity, inflammatory 
                            and asymmetrical patterns that are visualized by the subtle
                             physiologic patterns and changes that accompany breast
                              pathology. When activity is found early, your doctor can plan accordingly and lay out a careful
                             program to further diagnose and /or monitor you during and after any treatment.
                        </p>
                        <p>Not all masses in the breast are cancerous (in fact 8 out of 10 are fibroids and fluid
                             filled cysts.) Breast tissue is fatty and generally exudes cool temperatures
                             in normal findings. Abnormal breast 
                             screenings on a thermal scan have a few things in common.
                        </p>
                        <p><b>Asymmetry:</b>One breast is a different temperature than the other (more than 2 degrees).</p>
                        <p><b>Hot Spots:</b> Random areas of intense heat.</p>
                        <p><b>Asymmetry:</b>Which are visible and generate heat as they feed & grow</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>The benefit of breast thermography is that it offers the opportunity
                             of earlier detection of breast disease than has been possible 
                             through breast self examination, doctor examination or mammography alone.
                              Thermography's role in breast cancer and other breast disorders is 
                              to help in early detection and monitoring of abnormal physiology and
                               the establishment of risk factors for the development of disease.
                             It can be used with other procedures for the best possible evaluation of breast health.
                        </p>
                        <h6>Breast Thermography Does Not Replace Mammography</h6>
                        <p>These technologies are different and yield different information. 
                            A mammogram can show a structure that is already present
                             (e.g. a tumor or calcification) while thermography measures 
                             physiologic effects and changes. These effects/changes have
                              been shown to have a statistical correlation rather than a 
                              direct correlation to the development of breast cancer.
                               Thermography provides a practical benefit to the general 
                               public and to the medical profession. It is used as an adjunct
                                to the appropriate usage of mammography. In fact, thermography 
                                has the ability to identify clients at the highest risk and 
                                actually increase the effective usage of mammographic
                             imaging procedures. Consult your physician regarding recommendations for mammography.
                        </p>
                        <h6>The Power of Prevention</h6>

                        <p>This test is designed to improve chances for detecting fast-growing, 
                            active tumors in the intervals between mammographic screenings 
                            or when mammography is not indicated by screening guidelines for 
                            women under 50 years of age. By performing thermography years 
                            before conventional mammography, a selected at-risk population 
                            can be monitored carefully, and then by accurately utilizing 
                            mammography or ultrasound as soon as is possible to detect the actual lesion -
                             (once it has grown large enough and dense enough to be 
                             seen on mammographic film), can increase the 
                            clients treatment options and ultimately improve the outcome.

                        </p>
                        <p>Until such time as a cure has been found for this terrible disease, progress must be made in the 
                            fields of risk evaluation and early detection, coupled with sound clinical decision making.
                        </p>
                        <h6>The Process</h6>
                        <p>All thermograms (breast images) are kept on record and 
                            form a baseline image for monitoring future routine evaluations. Comparitive breast screenings 
                            are recommended 3-6 months after the first one to determine stability or change.
                        </p>
                        <p>All scans are sent out to be interpreted by an outside
                             team of medical physicians (M.D.s). The turnaround time for receiving reports
                             is 3-7 business days. You can have your report sent
                              to you via email, paper copy or disc copy.
                        </p>
