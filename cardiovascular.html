                            Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a group of diseases of the heart 
                            (cardio) and blood vessels (vascular) most often caused by 
                            a narrowing inside the lining of blood vessels due to deposits
                             of plaque or fatty substances on the artery wall. Cardiovascular
                              Disease is still the leading cause of disability and death in 
                              the United States and can include arteriosclerosis, coronary 
                              artery diseases (CAD), congestive heart failure, heart valve
                               disease, hypertension, endocarditis,
                             angina, and myocardial infarction, most commonly known as a heart attack.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Coronary artery disease is the build up of plaque in the
                             arteries which causes a decrease in blood supply (ischemia) to the heart. 
                             This condition can lead to serious problems such as angina (chest pain) or 
                             myocardial infarction (heart attack). Coronary artery 
                            disease is the most common form of cardiovascular disease, afflicting over 7 million people.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            According to the American Heart Association, approximately
                             50% of the people who die from heart disease experience no 
                             previous symptoms. The # 1 symptom of a heart attack is sudden death.
                              Symptoms of disease may be different and more subtle in women 
                            and therefore easier to ignore. More women die of heart disease than of all cancers combined.

                       <p>
                        The NIHA physicians place great emphasis on educating the patient on
                         prevention and treatment options for cardiovascular disease by
                          integrating both conventional medicine with complementary and
                           alternative medicine (CAM), so the patient can make educated 
                           choices that best reflect
                         their needs as an individual.Modification of
                          key risk factors is an integral part of the program.

                        The Cardiovascular Disease program includes: state-of-the-art cardiovascular 
                        screening and assessment of risk factors,  patient education on
                         nutrition and detoxification,  and an individualized integrative 
                         treatment plan including, but not limited to, chelation therapy*,
                          supplementation, and other beneficial treatments based on the
                           patient's risk factors and needs. NIHA also works in collaboration
                            with the patient’s primary care physician and/or cardiologist to
                             keep them informed of the patient’s 
                        progress and to refer the patient for additional medical tests and assessments.

                            Results of the INTERHEART study suggest that these modifiable 
                            risk factors account for more than 90% of the risk for acute
                             Myocardial Infarctions (heart attack).In descending order,these are:

                        for heavy metal toxicity and has been used for over 40 years to
                         reduce the vascular plaque that may cause cardiovascular disease, 
                         its effectiveness is still under study by the National
                          Intstitutes of Health. While a number of physicians 
                          provide chelation and its safety is well-known, the role 
                          of heavy metal toxicity in cardiovascular disease is not 
                          widely accepted and the medical 
                        community does not accept that chelaton has a role to play in cardiovascular treatment.
