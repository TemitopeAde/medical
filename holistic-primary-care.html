                        <h4>Holistic Primary Care</h4>
                        <p><b>Are you looking for a holistic primary care doctor who listens and spends time to understand your needs?</b></p>
                        <p>Holistic primary care is an integrative approach that treats the whole person: mind/body and spirit by blending conventional medicine with natural or complementary therapies.
                            A thorough  initial primary care visit will assess not just your current health status- but your diet, sleep, emotional wellbeing, stress management, exercise and other lifestyle habits that may contribute to your health conditions.</p>

                        <p>A primary care provider coordinates all of the health care a patient receives. This total patient care considers the physical and emotional needs of the person and how health issues may be affecting those needs. Whether you are coming in for an annual check-up or managing a chronic disease, we focus on the whole person, not just your disease or symptoms. Symptoms may have brought you to the doctor, but advanced lab testing can help identify and address the root cause. We consider test results, lifestyle factors, nutrition, and  stress management and develop a comprehensive treatment plan to help you attain an optimum level of wellness.</p>

                        <p>The holistic primary care model offers not only traditional primary care but also incorporates the best of complementary and alternative therapies  to help you achieve optimum wellness, not just freedom from disease. These therapies may include acupuncture, hormone therapy, IV therapies, or detoxification therapies. Our holistic primary care providers will be your partner and guide in helping you achieve your health goals.</p>

As a member of the Obesity Medicine Association, she received formal training in the medical treatment of obesity and has spent the last 12 years helping thousands of DC area residents reduce their disease burden, resulting in healthier lives. By implementing a holistic approach to weight loss, she incorporated the latest science, pharmacology, nutrition, and behavioral health into her practice.</p>
                            <p>When was confronted with her own health challenges, Dr. Tapscott began to explore alternative approaches that could (1) answer the question, why and (2) help her begin the healing process.  Although she did not abandon conventional medicine entirely, she gained a greater appreciation for her condition by using functional medicine and continues to implement healthy living with her family.   She now fully integrates a functional medical approach into her current practice - providing personalized, predictive, participatory, and preventive care to her patients.</p>
