                        <h4>LDA Therapy, Low Dose Allergen Immunotherapy</h4>

                        <p>Low Dose Allergen, or LDA therapy, is a safe and effective immunotherapy used to treat food allergies and environmental allergies as well as autoimmune conditions. Injections are typically used for adults, with a sublingual option for children.</p>
                    
                        <p>LDA treatment involves very low dose combinations of allergens along with an enzyme, beta-glucuronidase. The key component of this enzyme is that it attracts specific white blood cells (T-regulator cells) that are involved in the immune response and makes them pay attention to the allergens included with the enzyme. This causes a down-regulation, or calming of the response, of the part of the immune system that was reacting to the allergens in the first place. In other words, LDA works to shut off the adverse or allergenic response, and has a positive affect on the immune system. This is also the reason why it works well for most autoimmune conditions where the body is attacking itself.</p>


                        <h6>How Does LDA therapy Differ From Conventional Allergy Treatments?</h6>


                        <p>Conventional allergy medications work on blocking the histamine response, helping only when taken (and requiring patients to take medication indefinitely). Allergy shots and allergy drops work with the immune system to gradually build tolerance to specific allergens. Not only does LDA treat multiple (over 300) foods or inhalant allergies in a single treatment, it also works to reset the immune system's response, rather than just working to build up tolerance. It also can be used for more than just allergies because of how it works to reset the immune system. LDA is less expensive and also requires much less treatment - once every two months versus weekly allergy shots or daily allergy drops.</p>

                        <p><b>LDA Benefits Compared to Conventional Allergy Treatments:</b></p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Quick results (most patients see improvements within 1-3 treatments)</li>
                            <li>Long-lasting effects for a wide range of allergens</li>
                            <li>Less frequent treatments (once every 2 months initially, then less frequent)</li>
                            <li>Less expensive than conventional allergy therapy</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><b>Frequently Treated Conditions with LDA therapy:</b></p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Autoimmune Diseases: Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, Lupus (SLE), Rheumatoid Arthritis</li>
                            <li>Environmental Allergies, Asthma, Sinusitis</li>
                            <li>Food Allergies & Sensitivities</li>
                            <li>GI Issues: Crohn's Disease, Ulcerative Colitis</li>
                            <li>Lyme Disease</li>
                            <li>Skin Conditions: Dermatitis, Eczema, Psoriasis, Rosacea</li>
                        </ul>


                        <h6>What does LDA therapy involve?</h6>

                        <p>During an office visit, Dr. Kannankeril will determine if LDA is a suitable treatment for a patient and then put an order in for a specific injection. Patients will get one injection given every two months, with each treatment building on the next to restore natural immune tolerance. Gradually the interval between injections is extended until they are taken at yearly intervals. Most patients can either go a long time between injections or stop entirely after about 16 to 18 injections, with most patients noticing improvement within the first three doses.

                        </p>
                        <p>Dr. Kannankeril is on a short list of practitioners trained in LDA in the United States and able to order from the only lab who compounds LDA. She will make a clinicial decision  for the appropriate injection for each patient.</p>
